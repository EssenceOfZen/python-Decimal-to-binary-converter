This is a simple program used to convert a decimal number into a binary number. It utilizes a function that takes a number and follows the division algorithm and constantly checks and adds the 1 or 0 to a list and then reverses that list when completed. 

The code is mainly to be used to learn how to do said actions to better someone's skill. Feel free to modify and make changes to the program.

This code will be used in a later upgrade to the Assistant program.
